minute 3: icebreaker
there are a lot of libraries out there to use. most of them are created by independent developers and not all of them have cristal clear indstructions
some libraries have some bugs here and there and poor documentation about how to fix them

minute 4: how to set up your library? You do the same thing like building any other website. most libraries have a page on github where you can download their files. once you download their
files you kinda have to search where the dependecies are located and you copy and paste those files into your project folder and link them 
into your html. kinda the same way you would link your external css file to your html file

minute 5 once your configured your files, you have to read the documentation to understand how to use the library. most libraries have great 
documentation and examples on how to use them
