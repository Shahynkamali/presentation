 //minute 1: talk about what a open source project is//

 An open source project is a collection of code that executes a certain action a lot faster than doing it 
 manually with javascript or css
 couple populair open source projects are React, Jquery, Math.js and bootstrap
 these open source projects have their own attributes and classes that you have to use in order to executes the functions
 today we are going to talk about typed.js 

TALK ABOUT TYPED.JS
Typed.js is a javascript library created by Matt Boldt. It creates typed text animations like on your screen like you are typing on a typewriter
if you dont know what a typewriter looks like this is an old image i found on the internet of a typewriter

so in the next few minutes, i am going to show you four examples of what this library can do and how it works  I will show the example first and then go over the code briefly

the easiest way to get started is to copy the cdn link into your html and get the jquery cdn as well because this library works on jquery 
so i guess its a  jquery library?

show example

why would you use typed.js?
Its a great time saver if you want to create a a small interactive experience on your projects. 
You can definitly do this by yourself vanilla javascript or jquery 
but if you dont have the knowledge or the time, this would be a great alternative

show examples
